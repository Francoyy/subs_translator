1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,400
What happens if you drink a glass of unboiled tap water here in Taiwan?

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,500
Continue watching and find out.

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,960
After four years and interviewing countless of foreigners here on the channel,

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,960
I think we can all agree on three things.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,820
Taiwan is clean, safe, and it's also surrounded by water.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,880
But is the water in Taiwan just as clean and safe as the rest of the island?

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,960
Well, this might sound like a very simple question with a yes or no answer,

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,920
but it actually depends on who, where, and how you ask the question.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,040
And this question is actually something that I asked myself,

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,960
or, well, I asked Google, 13 years ago before the first time coming here to Taiwan.

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,100
Because I don't know about you, but for me, every time I travel to a new country,

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,120
there are three questions I always want an answer to.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,820
And the first one is, what kind of currency are they using in Taiwan in this example?

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,600
What kind of power outlets are they using in Taiwan?

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,100
And the third one is, can you actually drink the tap water in Taiwan?

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,680
Now, this is where it starts to get a little complicated,

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,120
because the first answer from Google is, the tap water in Taiwan is not very safe to drink.

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,900
And this is actually an official link from National Chongqing University's medical information page

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,360
for new potential international students coming here to Taiwan.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,840
But if you instead would Google, can you drink the tap water in Taipei?

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,260
The first answer is actually a link to the Taipei Water Department,

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,460
which clearly states in the first sentence, and I quote,

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,560
the water supplied by Taipei Water Department is definitely safe for drinking.

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,860
But even with this very confident statement from Taipei Water Department,

25
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,840
I have, during my 12 years here in Taiwan, never seen anyone actually drinking tap water.

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,620
And to all of you who will say, Lucas, what are you talking about?

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,060
Drinking tap water is totally fine.

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,340
All you have to do is first filter it, and then boil it, and then you can drink as much as you want.

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,280
If your argument is that you can drink tap water as long as you boil it,

30
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,100
it's basically like saying, I can walk on water just like Jesus.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,220
All you have to do is to freeze it first.

32
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,600
At least in my book, it just doesn't really count if you have to either boil or filter tap water before drinking it.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,180
Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that although Taipei Water Department

34
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,460
says that the water supplied by them is definitely safe to drink,

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,580
no one actually seems to be drinking it.

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,340
And during my 12 years and my personal non-scientific research at all,

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,020
I think that the main reason for this is that people are a little bit scared

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,320
since they live in older buildings that have older water pipes,

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,260
and they're not entirely sure what actually happens to the water

40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,520
once it leaves Taipei Water Department and then comes into their own taps in their own apartments.

41
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,940
So how could you actually find out if your specific tap in your specific apartment

42
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,620
will provide you with clean, safe, drinkable tap water?

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,980
Actually, the only thing you need to do is to go and visit Taipei Water Department's website

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,240
where they have the entire article about the quality of tap water in English for everyone to read.

45
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,240
And this is my absolute favorite part.

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,700
If you live in Taipei metropolis and are concerned about your tap water,

47
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,460
please feel free to call us and we will answer your questions on the phone

48
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,140
or make a field survey and examine the water quality for you.

49
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,160
The service is free of charge.

50
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,440
Or you could actually bring your own water here to Taipei Water Department.

51
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,040
I should point out that this video is not sponsored by Taipei Water Department.

52
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,380
They have no idea I'm even recording this video.

53
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,900
And now when I am thinking about it, I actually may not be able to record inside.

54
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,340
But regardless, let's go in and check it out.

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,820
Well, as I should have known before actually starting recording this video,

56
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,800
is that you do need to apply for a permit in order to actually record inside Taipei Water Department.

57
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,880
But regardless, the whole process was actually super simple

58
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,760
and they also have all the instructions on their website as well.

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,820
The only thing you need to do basically is just to fill up a plastic bottle with water

60
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:01,280
and then you head over to their office slash water factory in Dan District.

61
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,420
Right next to the best area in entire Taipei, Liu Changli.

62
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,760
If you do not live here already, definitely consider moving here

63
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,340
because this area is amazing.

64
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,740
Anyway, I did want to point out a few things before you actually bring your water over to Taipei Water Department.

65
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,200
And that is, of course, that you need to keep the water running for three minutes before you take the sample.

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,720
You need to have a clear plastic bottle.

67
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,620
But then they actually only test your straight tap water straight from your tap supplied by them.

68
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,440
So filtered waters or any other kind of water that is not supposed to be for drinking, I guess,

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,620
would not really be tested by them.

70
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,120
And then all you have to do is just fill out a form and then actually when they're done with the testing,

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,920
which should happen the same day if you give it to samples before 12,

72
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,860
and they did say that if you actually had some issues with the water,

73
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,160
like if there's been some renovation and something has broken,

74
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,660
they might have to do some more advanced testing.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,600
But this was a free test and you basically just get the real basic information telling you if it's drinkable or not.

76
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,260
But maybe you will not get the most analytical water levels and stuff.

77
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,840
I haven't seen the report yet, so I don't know how they look like.

78
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,360
So yeah, that's what we're waiting for right now.

79
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,260
And hopefully it will actually come here later today.

80
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,500
Otherwise, we don't have an ending for this video because I am going to go to Taidong tomorrow

81
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,360
and record another video over there.

82
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,140
So, yeah.

83
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,500
But while we are waiting, I do have some time to share some information regarding the sponsor of today's video,

84
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,340
which regardless of how this report from the Taipei Water Department looks like,

85
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,780
I guarantee you will take your love for water to a completely new level.

86
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,240
And I am of course talking about sparkling water from Celinda.

87
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,800
Now, normally when I am this excited, something really, really big has just happened.

88
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,460
But I think that this is the tiniest, biggest thing that has ever happened to me.

89
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,040
Because the SD300 sparkling water machine we recently installed in our apartment

90
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,080
is just a tiny little innocent water tap right next to our sink.

91
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,520
But please do not let the size fool you,

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,000
because this tap follows the Scandinavian approach of minimalistic design,

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,220
which we all love so much.

94
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,160
And all the magic is actually happening underneath the sink

95
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,580
with both a cooling pump and a tube full of sparkles.

96
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,480
Or, well, I guess, carbon dioxide,

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,480
since the technical term, I believe, is carbonated water and not sparkling water.

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,040
But, yeah, you get the point.

99
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,160
So, the water gets into this cooling pump

100
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,820
where you can actually control the specific degree of the water

101
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,700
from 1 to 12 degrees Celsius,

102
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,240
which means that you get the perfect temperature of water

103
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,400
every single time, right away,

104
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,180
as soon as you want your next glass.

105
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,180
And, and this is the magical part,

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,880
it's directly connected to this big tube of sparkles,

107
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,200
I mean carbon dioxide,

108
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,680
so you can get up to 490 liters of sparkling water

109
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,400
before you need to change the tube.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And honestly, I can just sit here for hours

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,280
talking about how incredible it is

112
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,080
to have your own sparkling water machine

113
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,400
built into the tap right next to your sink.

114
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,100
And also just how much better it is for the environment

115
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,940
compared to, like, going to 7-Eleven

116
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,180
and buying your daily, in my case,

117
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,480
sparkling water from these plastic bottles.

118
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,580
But there are no words in the world

119
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,840
who can describe just how incredibly cool it is

120
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,940
to just open up the tap

121
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,680
and get cold, sparkling water

122
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,860
straight from the tap, all the time.

123
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,440
I can go up in the middle of the night,

124
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,380
just flick the tap and get one tiny glass of sparkling water

125
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,000
before going back to sleep again

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
without having to go through the normal process

127
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,060
of first filling up a bottle of normal water,

128
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,200
putting it into a machine,

129
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,980
pressing a button for a few seconds,

130
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,040
taking the bottle and pouring it into a glass,

131
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,900
putting the rest of the bottle back into the fridge,

132
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,100
taking some ice cubes, putting it into my glass

133
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,740
in order to have an actually refreshing

134
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,520
glass of cold, sparkling water.

135
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,180
Now I can get a glass of sparkling water in literally

136
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,140
seconds, just as long as it would take

137
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,620
for me to pour up a glass of non-sparkling,

138
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,500
boring, old-fashioned

139
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,580
normal water.

140
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,980
But if this under-the-sink setup looks a little

141
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,940
bit intimidating, just know that Celinda will

142
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,000
of course come home to your apartment and install

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
this for you, so you do not need to lift

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,280
the finger at all. Except of course

145
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,700
when I actually had enough sparkling water

146
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,260
and want the machine to stop.

147
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,960
And it is actually the exact same process when

148
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,720
eventually you will run out of the 490

149
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,940
liters of sparkles.

150
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,880
If you do have these smaller containers,

151
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
then once you do run out after like

152
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,060
60 liters only, you are the one who

153
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,600
has to bring this to the department store

154
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,020
and then actually get it replaced there, and then bring it

155
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,780
back home again. Celinda will actually

156
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,020
come home with the new tank for you,

157
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
they will do the replacements, and then

158
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,780
you're ready to go in no time.

159
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,180
Now, there are a few things I want to make very clear,

160
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,220
especially considering the topic of today's video.

161
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,040
This is a sparkling water

162
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,360
machine, so it will actually add sparkles

163
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,300
or carbon dioxide to your water

164
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,020
and it also has a fridge

165
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,040
cooling function, so it will actually cool

166
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,880
down the water to your decided degree,

167
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,240
but it will not filter the water for you.

168
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,800
And Celinda is recommending

169
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,260
that you are using a separate filter system

170
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,040
which of course you can connect straight

171
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,740
into this under-the-sink machine,

172
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,200
just like we already had here in our apartment.

173
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,960
Secondly, if you for some reason

174
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,760
would not want to drink sparkling water

175
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,720
all the time, I don't really understand

176
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,800
why you wouldn't, the SD300

177
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,740
sparkling water machine does come with

178
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,800
a pass-through function as well, so you can get the

179
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,780
sparkling water from the left side, but if

180
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,860
you do want the original filtered water

181
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,760
without any sparkles to, for example,

182
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,800
fill up your coffee machine, you can get that

183
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,040
here on the right side as well.

184
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,420
And last but not least, if you want a little bit less

185
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,780
Scandinavian minimalistic approach, and a little bit more

186
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,120
show-off, majestic piece in your kitchen,

187
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,280
they also have other on-the-counter

188
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,940
design machines as well, which

189
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,460
will give you the same functions as the SD300

190
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,640
that we have in our kitchen,

191
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,760
but with this on-the-counter solution

192
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,960
instead. So please, do yourself a

193
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,600
favor, go check out Celinda's website

194
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,920
for a little bit more information, because I can

195
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,320
hand-on-heart 100%

196
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,840
say that this is

197
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,760
the best home

198
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,560
solution product, just

199
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,940
way of life, I have

200
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,080
ever experienced. I couldn't even dream

201
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,920
about this thing, but this is just a

202
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,780
completely different level, and

203
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,760
there is no going back

204
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,020
to drinking any other kind

205
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,880
of sparkling water. It is

206
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,060
absolutely amazing. I should also

207
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,880
mention, which I actually forgot,

208
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,000
you can actually also adjust the

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,940
amount of sparkles in the

210
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,940
tube as well, so if you have been worried

211
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,200
about that you cannot actually customize the amount

212
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,380
of sparkles,

213
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,820
you can. You can.

214
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,100
Yeah, that was it.

215
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,820
Sponsor segment over, but I still

216
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,660
have not received the

217
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,540
report from the Taipei Water Department.

218
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,880
I'm not really sure what to do now. I think

219
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,160
I have to actually stop recording

220
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,900
right now, then I'll get

221
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,920
back to you when I have a

222
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,760
reply from the report, and

223
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,920
see if we can actually drink

224
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,400
the water that I just drank

225
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,300
in the beginning of this video.

226
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,060
And now, a few days later, we are once again back

227
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,840
here at Taipei Water Department, since

228
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,000
we now finally got our water

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,900
results back. Let's go back home

230
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,520
to the studio and check it out.

231
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,860
Okay, so now we're back from Taipei Water

232
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,080
Department, and in my hand

233
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,060
I have, at least I hope

234
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,060
I have, my water report

235
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,800
which will tell me

236
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,660
that the tap water here in the apartment

237
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,360
is safe to drink.

238
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
Let's see. Notification of

239
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,060
water quality test results.

240
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,100
The water sample

241
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
scent were tested for turbidity,

242
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,800
no idea what that is, residual

243
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,160
chlorine, pH, and total

244
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,180
dissolved solids. And the results

245
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,340
were found to compliance to Taiwan's

246
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,140
drinking water quality standards.

247
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,120
The key to safe drinking water quality

248
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,300
lies in regular cleaning and maintenance of water equipment

249
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,180
such as water basins and rooftop water towers.

250
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,400
We recommend to clean and maintain water basins

251
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,180
and water towers at least once a year.

252
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,200
Well, we all know I'm not going to be the one cleaning

253
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,160
our rooftop water tower, but I

254
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,760
do hope that my landlord has

255
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,280
everything under control. Should you have any questions,

256
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,340
please contact us through our service hotline

257
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,560
and you'll have the number down there.

258
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,040
Whew, okay.

259
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,580
It looks like our drinking tap

260
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,800
water is up to Taiwan's

261
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,360
drinking water quality standards.

262
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,360
Yeah, they actually

263
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,400
said before that the report that you will

264
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,320
get is basically like yes or no.

265
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,680
Can you drink it or can you not?

266
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,300
If it's considered that you can

267
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,340
drink it, then this free test does

268
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,000
not include any more information

269
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,960
such as, for example,

270
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,000
whatever turbidity

271
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,720
means. No idea.

272
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,860
But yeah, so it turns out

273
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,060
that my whole life here

274
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,060
in Taiwan has been a lie because apparently

275
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,620
at least in this apartment

276
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,920
I have been able to actually

277
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,220
drink the tap water this whole time.

278
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,200
But then again, I barely drink

279
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,180
normal water anymore since I do try

280
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,820
to have a sparkling water

281
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,920
diet thanks to Celinda.

282
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,060
And once again, they do recommend that we

283
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,960
do have this filter tap system, which

284
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,580
we already have in the apartment.

285
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,860
So if I'm going to be completely honest,

286
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,800
I will continue using that

287
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,000
filter tap water into my

288
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,840
sparkling water machine and

289
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,960
continue my sparkling water diet.

290
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,920
But hopefully this helps

291
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,980
some of you Taiwanese people, but

292
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,440
also foreigners coming here.

293
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,920
One thing to actually know, if you can drink

294
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,960
the tap water here, at least in

295
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,200
Taipei or not. And I'm sure

296
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,920
that every other county, every other city

297
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
will have your own water departments

298
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,300
where you can just contact.

299
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,580
And they were super friendly.

300
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,740
They told me that they were a little surprised

301
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,860
I think seeing a foreigner walking

302
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,540
in there. So I don't think this is a service

303
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,140
that a lot of foreigners in Taiwan knows about.

304
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,600
And they said that most of the time,

305
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,680
if there has been a big accident or something

306
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,000
in the neighborhood or in a specific

307
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,940
building, then there would be a lot

308
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,260
of people coming at the same time.

309
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,940
So they have based on these situations.

310
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,980
And I'm pretty sure

311
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,360
that was the first time they saw

312
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,380
a foreigner walking in

313
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,760
just randomly asking.

314
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,720
Because the first question they said was like

315
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,980
What kind of water is this?

316
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm like, YouTube video?

317
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,740
But yeah, they were super cool about it.

318
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,420
And it's free.

319
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,500
It's been a few days since I drank that

320
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,120
first glass of tap water.

321
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,940
Yeah.

322
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,680
All good. Cannot complain at all.

323
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,440
And hopefully you also

324
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,500
do not complain about this video. And in fact

325
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,480
if you do like this video, please do

click that like button to show your support.

327
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,340
Please also help me share this video with someone

328
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,400
who maybe want a little bit more information

329
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,300
regarding the tap water quality

330
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,600
at least here in Taipei or where you can

331
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,660
find out more information if you want to test

332
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,560
your own tap water here in Taiwan.

333
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,680
Thank you all so much for watching.

334
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,600
My name is Lukas. Starts with L

335
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,540
as in like. Ends with S as in

336
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,020
subscribe. Please do both.

337
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,160
And see you all in the next one.
